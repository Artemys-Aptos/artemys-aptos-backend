# Artemys Backend

This repository contains the backend code for **[Artemys](https://www.artemysai.xyz/)**, an AI Prompt Marketplace built for the Aptos Hackathon. It provides API endpoints for managing prompts, user interactions, social features, and leaderboards, all designed to integrate with the Aptos blockchain.

## ðŸ¤– Overview

Artemys backend is built using FastAPI and interacts with a database (PostgreSQL) to store and manage data related to AI prompts, user activity, and leaderboards. It uses Celery for background tasks like finalizing challenges, which involve interacting with Aptos smart contracts.

## ðŸ¤– API Endpoints

### Prompt Marketplace Endpoints

* **POST `/add-premium-prompts`:** Adds a new premium prompt to the marketplace. These premium prompts are likely linked to NFTs on the Aptos blockchain.
* **GET `/get-premium-prompts`:** Retrieves all premium prompts.
* **GET `/premium-prompt-filters`:**  Gets all available filters for premium prompts (e.g., recent, popular, trending).
* **POST `/filter-premium-prompts`:** Filters premium prompts based on the provided filter type.
* **POST `/add-public-prompts`:** Adds a new public prompt.
* **GET `/prompt-tags`:** Retrieves all available prompt tags.
* **GET `/get-public-prompts`:** Retrieves all public prompts.
* **POST `/filter-public-prompts`:** Filters public prompts based on tag and visibility.

### Leaderboard Endpoints

* **GET `/generations-24h`:**  Leaderboard based on the number of generations in the last 24 hours. This might track the usage of prompts or the creation of AI-generated content.
* **GET `/streaks`:** Leaderboard based on consecutive days with generations, encouraging user engagement.
* **GET `/xp`:** Leaderboard based on user XP, potentially earned through activities on the platform.

### Social Feed Endpoints

* **POST `/like-prompt`:** Likes a public or premium prompt.
* **POST `/comment-prompt`:** Adds a comment to a prompt.
* **GET `/get-prompt-comments`:** Retrieves comments for a prompt.
* **POST `/follow-creator`:**  Follows a creator.
* **DELETE `/unfollow-creator`:** Unfollows a creator.
* **GET `/creator-followers`:** Gets a list of followers for a creator.
* **GET `/user-following`:** Gets a list of creators a user is following.
* **GET `/feed`:** Retrieves the social feed for a user (prompts from followed creators and new creators).
* **GET `/feed/followers`:** Gets a feed of prompts from the user's followers.
* **GET `/feed/following`:** Gets a feed of prompts from the creators the user is following.
* **GET `/feed/combined`:** Gets a combined feed from followers and following.
* **GET `/prompt-likes`:** Retrieves the number of likes for a prompt and whether the user has liked it.

## ðŸ¤– Tasks

* **`finalize_challenges`:** A Celery task scheduled to run every 30 minutes. This task might interact with the Aptos blockchain to determine challenge winners and distribute prizes.

## ðŸ¤– Database

The Artemys backend uses a database (PostgreSQL) to store:

* Prompts (public and premium)
* User interactions (likes, comments, follows)
* User statistics (for leaderboards)

## ðŸ¤– Dependencies

The project uses the following key dependencies:

* FastAPI
* SQLAlchemy
* Celery
* Requests

## ðŸ¤– Running the Application

1. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Configure environment variables:** Set the required environment variables (e.g., database connection string, API keys, Aptos node URL).
3. **Run the FastAPI application:** `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
4. **Start the Celery worker:** `celery -A app.celery.celery.celery_app worker --loglevel=info`
5. **Start the Celery beat scheduler:** `celery -A app.celery.celery.celery_app beat --loglevel=info`

**Note:** This README assumes you have basic knowledge of setting up and running FastAPI applications, Celery workers, and interacting with the Aptos blockchain.
